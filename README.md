# Analysis of AdventureWorks database in MS SQL

In this repository, I will be analyzing the AdventureWorks demo database for MS SQL. There are over 20 tables in this database which have information on customers, sales, transactions, products, and more. It is a very extensive sample database that is based on a real business. This database can be downloaded from Microsoft's website, but I will provide the version I used in this repository.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to understand the AdventureWorks database thoroughly and do simple analysis using complex queries in SSMS.
